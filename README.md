# SpaceGolf - Golf in Space
This is a small game made in Unity for the Introduction to Unity course at University Osnabrueck.

The idea of the game is to play golf on a planet. By using Newton's law of gravity we can easily simulate sphere based gravity.
Another interesting thing we wanted to achieve is to precalculate the trajectory of the ball in order for the player to more easily plan their shot.
